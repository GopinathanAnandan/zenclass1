objects and its internal representation in Javascript:

    Objects are important data types in javascript. Objects are different than primitive datatypes 
    (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.). Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can 
    hold many values in form of Key: value pair. These keys can be variables or functions and are
    called properties. Various methods in objects are,
        1. Constructor
        2. Static methods
        3. Instance methods
        4. Instance property

    Constructor:

        object()
            turns the input into object.
    
    Static methods:

        Static methods must not rely on data from a specific object. Some of the static methods are,
          i.Object.assign()
                Copies the values of all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects 
                to a target object.

         ii.Object.create()
                Creates a new object with the specified prototype object and properties. 

    Instance methods:

        Instance methods rely on each object's specific data and some of the instamce methods are,
           i.Object.prototype.toString()
                Returns a string representation of the object.

          ii.Object.prototype.valueOf()
                Returns the primitive value of the specified object.
    
    Instance property:

        Object.prototype.constructor
            The constructor function that created the instance object. For plain Object instances, 
            the initial value is the Object constructor. Instances of other constructors each inherit 
            the constructor property from their respective Constructor.prototype object.
