 Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

    HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and it is a method for transporting information 
    between a  web browser and a web server. There are several stages of development of HTTP,
    HTTP1.1(standardized protocol) has drawbacks that lead to the creation of HTTP/2, which
    has several improvements for greater performance. The significant differences are,

                   HTTP1.1                      |               HTTP2                         
                                                |
    1.  It is a text-based protocol that means  | 1. It is a binary protocol that means it converts
        requests and responses are text format. |    all the messages in binary format.
                                                |
    2.  It uses one TCP connection for every    | 2. It allows multiplexing that is one TCP connection
        single request. If that request is slow |    is used for multiple requests. So it rectify HOL
        it blocks all other requests on the     |    blocking
        same connection. This is called head of |
        line blocking (HOL blocking).           |
                                                |
    3.  It sends headers with every request. If | 3. It uses HPACK for header compression to reduce
        a request is made more than once,it may |    the size of the header. It eliminates overhead

                                                |
    4.  The server can only send resources in   | 4. The server sends all the other files like CSS 
        response to a request from the client.  |    and JS without the request of the client using
